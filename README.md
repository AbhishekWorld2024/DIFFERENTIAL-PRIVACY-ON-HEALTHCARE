# DIFFERENTIAL-PRIVACY-ON-HEALTHCARE

<h2>ðŸ”’ Privacy-Preserving Framework for Healthcare Data</h2>

<p>
  This project presents a comprehensive framework that integrates state-of-the-art privacy-preserving techniques to address critical privacy concerns in healthcare data.
</p>

<h3>ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Differential Privacy:</strong> Implements differential privacy to enhance the confidentiality of individual records. The Laplace mechanism is utilized to incorporate precisely calibrated noise into numeric columns such as <code>Age</code>, <code>Billing Amount</code>, and <code>Room Number</code>, maintaining data integrity while augmenting privacy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Masking:</strong> Applies data masking to anonymize columns like <code>Medical Condition</code> and <code>Name</code> by restricting their representation to a specific maximum length.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hashing and Tokenization:</strong> Utilizes hashing for tokenization to protect specific columns such as <code>Hospital</code>, <code>Insurance Provider</code>, and <code>Medication</code> against security breaches.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Privacy Budget (Îµ):</strong> Introduces the concept of a privacy budget (Îµ) as a parameter, allowing users to have concrete control over the degree of privacy they wish to preserve.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>âœ… Outcome</h3>

<p>
  This comprehensive approach yields a refined healthcare dataset, establishing the groundwork for responsible data handling and contributing to the ongoing conversation about privacy in the healthcare industry.
