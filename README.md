we present a comprehensive framework that integrates state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving techniques, addressing the critical privacy concern in healthcare data. As<br>
healthcare records become more digitally digitized, strong privacy safeguards are becoming
essential to safeguard confidential data and guarantee moral standards are followed.<br>
The main goal of our project is to strengthen the confidentiality of individual records by
implementing differential privacy, a paradigm that is widely acknowledged. The Laplace<br>
mechanism is utilized to incorporate precisely calibrated noise into numeric columns, like
'Age,' 'Billing Amount,' and 'Room Number,' maintaining data integrity while augmenting<br>
privacy. Moreover, data masking is incorporated to anonymize columns, like 'Medical
Condition' and 'Name,' by restricting their representation to a specific maximum length.<br>
Applying hashing to tokenization, specific columns such as 'Hospital,' 'Insurance Provider,' and
'Medication' are protected against security breaches. Recognizing the complex nature of<br>
healthcare data, we aim to achieve a careful balance between privacy and data utility through
these measures. To give users concrete control over the degree of privacy they desire to<br>
preserve, the project presents the idea of a privacy budget (Îµ) as a parameter. This
comprehensive method yields a refined healthcare dataset, establishing the groundwork for<br>
responsible data handling and adding to the ongoing conversation about privacy in the
healthcare industry<br>
