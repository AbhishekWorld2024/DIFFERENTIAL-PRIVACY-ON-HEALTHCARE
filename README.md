    We present a comprehensive framework that integrates state-of-the-art privacy-preserving techniques, addressing the critical privacy concern in healthcare data.<br> 
    As healthcare records become more digitally digitized, strong privacy safeguards are becoming essential to safeguard confidential data and guarantee moral standards are followed.<br>
</p>

<p>
    The main goal of our project is to strengthen the confidentiality of individual records by implementing differential privacy, a paradigm that is widely acknowledged.<br> 
    The Laplace mechanism is utilized to incorporate precisely calibrated noise into numeric columns, like 'Age,' 'Billing Amount,' and 'Room Number,' maintaining data integrity while augmenting privacy.<br> 
    Moreover, data masking is incorporated to anonymize columns, like 'Medical Condition' and 'Name,' by restricting their representation to a specific maximum length.<br>
</p>

<p>
    Applying hashing to tokenization, specific columns such as 'Hospital,' 'Insurance Provider,' and 'Medication' are protected against security breaches.<br> 
    Recognizing the complex nature of healthcare data, we aim to achieve a careful balance between privacy and data utility through these measures.<br> 
    To give users concrete control over the degree of privacy they desire to preserve, the project presents the idea of a privacy budget (Îµ) as a parameter.<br>
</p>

<p>
    This comprehensive method yields a refined healthcare dataset, establishing the groundwork for responsible data handling and adding to the ongoing conversation about privacy in the healthcare industry.<br>
